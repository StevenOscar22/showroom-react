      <h2>1974 Chevrolet Impala Sport Sedan's Technology</h2>
      <p>
        The 427 was available with a 1282 ft³/min (605 L/s) Rochester 3X2-barrel
        carburetors arrangement, which the factory called Tri-Power producing
        435 bhp (441 PS; 324 kW) at 5800 rpm and 460 lb⋅ft (624 N⋅m) at 4000 rpm
        of torque.The ultimate Corvette engine for 1967 was coded L88, even
        wilder than the L89, and was as close to a pure racing engine as Chevy
        had ever offered in regular production. Besides the lightweight heads
        and bigger ports, it came with an even hotter camshaft, stratospheric
        12.5:1 compression, an aluminum radiator, small-diameter flywheel, and a
        single huge Holley four-barrel carburetor. Although the factory
        advertised L88 rating was 430 bhp at 4600 rpm, the true rating was said
        to be about 560 bhp at 6400 rpm. The very high compression ratio
        required 103-octane racing fuel, which was available only at select
        service stations. Clearly this was not an engine for the casual
        motorist. When the L88 was ordered, Chevy made several individual
        options mandatory, including Positraction, the transistorized ignition,
        heavy-duty suspension, and power brakes, as well as RPO C48, which
        deleted the normal radio and heater to cut down on weight and discourage
        the car's use on the street. As costly as it was powerful – at an
        additional $1,500 over the base $4,240.75 price – the L88 engine and
        required options were sold to a mere 20 buyers that year. With potential
        buyers anticipating the car's overdue redesign, sales for the Sting
        Ray's final year totaled 22,940, down over 5,000 units from 1966
        results. Meanwhile, Chevrolet readied its third-generation Corvette for
        the 1968 model year.
